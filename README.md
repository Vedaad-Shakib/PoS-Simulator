# PoS-Simulator
Make a generalized Proof of Stake (PoS) simulator that simulates the real-life behavior of different PoS systems, where the user can inject their own consensus mechanisms and incentive schemes by programming the behavior of nodes. This allows for simple proof of concepts for generalized PoS systems and allows users to analyze security, safety and liveness, crypto-economic convergence, and long-term viability of a system.
